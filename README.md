# Deep-Q-learning
Implementation and analysis of a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent trained to play the Breakout game. The project explores the limitations of traditional Q-Learning in complex environments (e.g., chess), introduces the DQL approach using dual neural networks (main and target), and compares constant vs decaying epsilon exploration strategies.
